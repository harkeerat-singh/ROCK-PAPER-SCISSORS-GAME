this was really fun to make , i learnt a lot of new algorithms and programming techniques




features on the surface:



its a platformer

uses alot of pictures

has a fully functioning leaderboard where you enter your name

the leaderboard uses bubble sort algorithm

has a boot screen

uses sequenced apperances 

has different menus

has a full tutorial on how to play the game with message boxes and timed apperances

has a coutndown timer before starting

has gravity, exponential motion and jumping by using form1.keys or whatever its called

has buttons which change the picture on the player (rock,paper,scissors)

the enemies move and have inteligence(ie they dont fall of their platforms)

they also change pictures sequentially

there is a goal screen (which you will adore :D)

the player can choose to play again or exit so they dont have to load the program each time

if you go to the goal without killing all the enemies then you get reset

you are timed on how fast you complete the game

you get put on the leaderboard#


and probably more features too


BEHIND THE SCREEN:










features behind the screen:

uses functions so that code is not reptitive
has an initialize function to reset all the game variables
the game is running underneath a game timer so the game can be stopped and played when needed
uses timers to sequence outputs (the coutndown)
uses iteration through text files and reading/writing
uses bubble sort
uses if ,for and while loops
iterates through this.controls using for loops
and probably more

has developer mode CTRL ALT O , for changing variables and cool stuff like that

the password is the in the debug/bin/key/.txt

it shows a login screen before hand and reads a password from a txt files

if a wrong password is entered an error code is stored in logban.txt 

and the user is locked out of the program no matter how many times they restart it
unless the logban file is cleared#

if you get locked out just open logban.txt and delete everything
